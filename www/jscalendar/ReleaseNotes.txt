FEATURES/BUGFIXES
	If you have written a new feature or fixed a bug in the code, please submit all changed files or a diff file to lqqkout13@users.sourceforge.net.
	
TRANSLATIONS
	If you have a translation complete, please email the language file to nkorbel@php.brickhost.com.  Please make sure that you take full credit for the translation by including your name and email  address, if you wish.

	I will be testing with all language files I receive to look for PHP syntax or runtime errors. Please test phpScheduleIt with your translation and report any bugs to the 'Developers' forum on SourceForge http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1104186&forum_id=331297.
